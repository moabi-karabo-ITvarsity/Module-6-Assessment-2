					<p>The Peugeot Landtrek is built in China and retains some styling traits of the French marque, both inside and out. Peugeot is offering the Landtrek in 2 flavours: Allure 4×2 and 4Action 4×4. Both are powered by a 1.9-litre 4-cylinder turbodiesel engine that produces 110 kW and 350 Nm and is combined with a 6-speed automatic transmission. So far, the newcomer is on trend with the market’s preferences, then.</p>
					
					<p>In terms of off-road capabilities, the Landtrek 4Action 4×4 offers shift-on-the-fly 2H to 4H, as well as a low-range transfer case (for 4L), has an approach/departure angle of 29 and 27 degrees respectively, a maximum wading depth of 600 mm and a ground clearance of 235 mm, which puts it in good company.</p>
					
					<p>The Allure 4×2 and 4Action 4×4 come with an impressive array of standard equipment and customers can choose from 6 exterior finishes. Peugeot SA also confirmed it would be offering an accessories programme for the bakkie, which includes canopies, bike racks, and roof racks, to name but a few options.</p>
					<p>Not to be unkind, but the Peugeot Landtrek is unlikely to challenge the marquee bakkie nameplates (Hilux and Ranger). Peugeot, despite its bakkie history, simply does not have brand cachet in the bakkie market, which partly explains why the discontinued (Mitsubishi Triton-based) Fiat Fullback never sold well. The bakkie fraternity is decidedly brand-loyal and usually reluctant to adopt as-yet-unproven models.</p>
						
					<p>Having said that, with the bakkie market being so diverse (it offers a variety of models across a broad price spectrum), there’s an opportunity for the Peugeot Landtrek to steal sales from the other fringe players, such as the Mazda BT-50, Mahindra Pik-Up and Mitsubishi Triton. The tremendous value-for-money proposition of Chinese brand GWM’s P-Series is bound to trouble all of the above, however.</p>
						
					<p>So, should you take a second look at the Peugeot Landtrek? The newcomer offers a well-appointed, upmarket cabin with good levels of fit and finish – it will certainly appeal to family-car buyers. The weak point of the Landtrek package is its seemingly gutless powertrain. Peugeot, JAC and Mazda offer a 1.9-litre turbodiesel engine in their bakkies, but most manufacturers offer bigger motors in their products and we have to remind ourselves that the majority of bakkies that journalists evaluate produce considerably higher outputs than the Landtrek. Perhaps we should lower our expectations accordingly.</p>

					<p>Since its introduction in 2016, the F-Pace has gone on to become Jaguar’s best-selling model around the globe. The 2021-spec model incorporates subtle exterior design changes, but its interior has received a major overhaul – it now features a new cabin layout and a bigger, faster-reacting infotainment system.</p>
					
					<p>Our test unit came specified with the optional new Black exterior pack, which includes gloss black finishes to the bumpers, grille and badging. It ramps of the Jaguar’s kerb- and road presence appreciably and the gloss black elements are complemented by matching 20-inch alloy wheels. I have to admit, the test unit’s black and white contrast looks quite attractive on the new model, especially at night, when the new “J-shaped” LED lighting elements project an imposing glare down the road.</p>
					<p>Jaguar has committed to a fossil-fuel-free future from 2025, so we can’t really expect much in the way of performance development from the current range of internal combustion engines. The D200’s 2.0-litre turbodiesel engine produces 150 kW and 430 Nm of torque; the motor proves economical and pleasingly smooth in combination with the 8-speed automatic transmission. So, the Jaguar’s performance is perfectly okay for commuting, but this is a R1.2 million SUV. An owner of a Toyota Hilux that costs half that price will tell you their bakkie produces the same power output and more torque (500 Nm).
					</p>
					<p>The bigger engines have always suited the F-Pace; our personal favourite is the D300. Its 3.0-litre 6-cylinder turbodiesel motor’s power/torque advantage over its 4-cylinder stablemate (71 kW/220 Nm) is considerable. The D300 AWD R-Dynamic HSE commands a R115k premium over this D200 derivative – its direct counterpart. The mid-spec D300 R-Dynamic SE, however, is only R31k dearer…
					
					To be fair, it’s only when you’ve loaded the D200 with people and things that you’ll notice its leisurely acceleration. Consumers expect more than sufficient engine grunt from a luxury vehicle, but overtaking manoeuvres just take a little bit longer to execute in this Jaguar. The thing is, you’re not really better off in any of its rivals: the equivalent (Audi) Q5, X3 and GLC have similar power outputs and less torque.</p>
